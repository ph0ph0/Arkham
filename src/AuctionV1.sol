/**
 * @title Auction Contract Version 1
 * 
 *     @notice This contract allows for the creation and bidding on auction listings
 *     in a decentralized manner.
 * 
 *     @dev Users can submit auction listings on our platform and then fund them via this smart
 *     contract by paying the stake and setting the paramaters needed.
 * 
 *     The listingID is unique and generated off-chain on the platform side. It is used to identify the listing
 *     and what is being sold.
 * 
 *     Once an auction listing is created on chain (by funding it), users can bid on it.
 * 
 *     The auction listing can be closed by approvers (designated by the contract owner).
 * 
 *     When the auction has expired, or been closed due to a buyout bid being placed, the seller (or approvers on
 *     behaf of the owner) can claim the funds from the auction. If this is done during the cooldown period, after the auction
 *     has ended, a fee is applied.
 * 
 *     The winning bid is the highest bid when the auction expires or the first bid to reach the buyout price.
 * 
 *     There is also the option for the seller to not put up the listing as an action but rather just allow a single buyout price.
